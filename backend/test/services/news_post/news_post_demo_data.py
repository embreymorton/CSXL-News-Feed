Starting this upcoming fall 2024 semester, I will be leading the DTH's first-of-its-kind engineering team! Could you please share the following information with Computer Science students? This new team will work on various news engineering projects to support the DTH. This includes developing multimedia news articles, building full-stack web applications, and generally supporting DTH journalism with technology! We are looking for interested students who have some experience building web products. Specifically, you should have previous experience working with the web and preferably modern web frameworks like React, Svelte, Angular, etc. Although we are seeking students with some experience, the DTH fundamentally emphasizes learning and experimentation, so you do not need to be an expert! The application will open in July and we are looking to bring on ~5 members for the first cohort of this team. This is a great opportunity for anyone looking to gain real world software engineering experience. If you have any questions, please reach out to me at ldavidson@unc.edu.

Size is also a potential issue, as he is listed at 6'0 and 180 pounds. \n Perhaps he can overcome some of those factors with an eye on the 2025 draft by putting more excellent basketball on tape during his final season at North Carolina.",
